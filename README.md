# Sand Carousel
A simple JavaScript carousel.
**WARNING**, the project is still in development.

## About
![A screen shot of the carousel](/demo/demo-picture.png "The Sand Carousel with dot controls, in pink")
My main goal is to make a very simple and light carousel that I can use for my projects. There are still quite a few things that I would like to change. I used vanilla JavaScipt for the initiation and the options, and CSS for the animation.

## Usage
1. Link the stylesheet and the script files from the dist folder:
```html
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="sand-carousel.css">
</head>
<body>
    ...
    <script src="sand-carousel.js"></script>
</body>
```
2. The markup should look something like this:
```html
<ul class="sand-carousel slides-wrapper">
	<li class="slide">Slide 1</li>
	<li class="slide">Slide 2</li>
	<li class="slide">Slide 3</li>
</ul>

<!--
  -- The two classes of the containing element â€”
  -- 'sand-carousel' and 'slides-wrapper', and
  -- the 'slide' class of the carousel's items
  -- are required.
  -->
```
3. Initiate the carousel by declaring a new instance of the `SandCarousel` class:
```js
let containerSelector   = ".sand-carousel";
let singleSlideSelector	= ".slide";
let slideDuration       = 6000;
let transitionDuration	= 500;	 // 500ms by dafault
let resizable           = false; // false by defailt
let autoPlay            = true;  // true by default

// NOTE! The autoplay property in the constructor
// is set to false if the slider is resizable
// this.autoplay = resizable ? false : autoplay

const SAND_CAROUSEL     = new SandCarousel(containerSelector, singleSlideSelector, slideDuration, transitionDuration, resizable, autoPlay);
```
3. Then call one of the methods `dotControls()` or `arrowControls()`:
```js
SAND_CAROUSEL.dotControls();
```

## To do
- Review of the code;
- add lazy loadgin.

## Known issues
- The sliding variation starts from the second slide.
